# 1.Create a Database.
Here, we are going to create a database with three tables: `temperatures`, `stations`, and `countries` in our current directory.

First, we need to import `sqlite3` package and make a connection to finally create a database named `Blog_Post_1_1.db`.

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("Blog_Post_1_1.db")
```

Let's note that our original data `temps.csv` is really big; it has 1.3 million rows with 14 columns. 

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("temps.csv")
df.shape
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_0.jpg)

We are going to use a database to get subsets of the data when we need it. To work with `temps.csv`, we need to get `countries` and `stations` data as well.

```python
countries_url = """https://raw.githubusercontent.com
/mysociety/gaze/master/data/
fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"""
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url)
countries = countries.rename({"Name" : "Country"}, axis = 1)
countries = countries.rename({"FIPS 10-4" : "Code"}, axis = 1)
countries = countries.drop("ISO 3166", axis = 1)

countries
```

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_1.jpg)

```python
url = """https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn
/station-metadata.csv""" 
stations = pd.read_csv(url)
stations
```

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_2.jpg)


Instead of working the huge size data, we are going to use an `iterator`, so that we can see a subset of data with size equal to `chunksize`. 

```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv",chunksize=100000)
df = df_iter.__next__()
df
```

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_3.jpg)


Okay, before we create a database, let's prepare our dataframe. Here, we are going to take only `ID`, `Year`, `Month`, `Temp`, and `Code`, which represents a country code.

```python
def prepare_df(df):
    """
    Prepare the dataframe for only necessary columns.
    
    @param df(DataFrame): the dataframe to prepare.
    """
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" 
                              , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    
    df["Code"] = df["ID"].str[0:2]
    return(df)

df = prepare_df(df)
df
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_4.jpg)

Now, we are going to write to our database, by creating a tables called `temperatures`, `stations`, `countries`.

```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, 
              if_exists = "append", index = False)

stations.to_sql("stations", conn, 
                if_exists = "replace", index = False)

countries.to_sql("countries", conn,
                 if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Let's see what tables are created.

```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("""SELECT name FROM 
sqlite_master WHERE type='table'""")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_5.jpg)

Let's also see the columns of each table.

```python
cursor.execute("""SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master
               WHERE type='table';""")

for result in cursor.fetchall():
    print(result[0])
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_6.jpg)

Everything looks good, let's close the connection.

```python
conn.close()
```

# 2.Query Function

We need to take a subset of the huge data, which is saved in the database we created in step 1.

Here, we will write a function called `query_climate_database()` that accepts four arguments:

- `country`, a string, the name of a country for which data should be returned.

- `year_begin` and `year_end`, integers, the earliest and latest years for which data should be returned.

- `month`, an integer, the month of the year for which data should be returned

The return value of `query_climate_database()` is a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year. This dataframe should have columns for:

-   The station name.
-   The latitude of the station.
-   The longitude of the station.
-   The name of the country in which the station is located.
-   The year in which the reading was taken.
-   The month in which the reading was taken.
-   The average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month.

```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("Blog_Post_1_1.db")

def query_climate_database(country,year_begin,year_end,month):
    """
    Query a database with specified information.
    
    @param country(str): the name of the country
    @param year_begin(int): the starting year to take
    @param year_end(int): the ending year to take
    @param month(int): the specific month of each year.
    
    @return df(DataFrame): the subset of the data.
    """
    
    
    cmd =f"""
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, 
        C.country, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C on T.code = C.code
    WHERE C.country == "{country}" AND 
        T.year >= {year_begin} AND 
        T.year <= {year_end} AND T.month == {month}
    """
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd,conn)
    return(df)
```
Here we use a command with `f` type multiline to take the specified information. Let's test it!

```python
query_climate_database(country = "India",
                      year_begin = 1980,
                      year_end = 2020,
                      month = 1)
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_query_00.jpg)

# 3.Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases.

Here, I want to visualize that addresses the following question:

## How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?

To do this, we need to write a function called `temperature_coefficient_plot()`, that accepts the following explicit arguments:

-   `country`, `year_begin`, `year_end`, and `month` should be as in the previous part.
-   `min_obs`, **the minimum required number of years** of     data for any given station. 
-   **kwargs, additional keyword arguments passed to px.       scatter_mapbox(). 

First, let's filter such stations in a given country that has less than **the specified minimum years**. 

For example, let's take a look at the subset of data for **India** between **1980 and 2020** on **January** only. Then, we are going to filter out stations that have **less then 10 years of recording**. 

```python
df_db = query_climate_database(country = "India",
                      year_begin = 1980,
                      year_end = 2020,
                      month = 1)

df_db
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_7.jpg)

Okay, let's take a look at the number of stations.

```python
len(df_db["NAME"].unique()) #number of stations
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_8.jpg)

Maybe let's take a look at **the first and last stations** in the data.

```python
df_db["NAME"].unique()[0] #first station
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_9.jpg)

```python
df_db["NAME"].unique()[103] #last station
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_database_10.jpg)

Then, we need to know **how many years each station have recording**.

```python
#number of years in each station

num_years = []

import numpy as np

for i in range(len(df_db["NAME"].unique())):
     num_years.append(
         len(df_db[
             df_db["NAME"] == df_db["NAME"].unique()[i]]
                   ["Year"].unique()))

num_years = np.asarray(num_years)
num_years 
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_query_0.jpg)

This is a array of numbers that represent **the number of years** each station have recording.

Next, we need to find the index of each station that have **less than 10 years of recording**.

```python
#What are the indices of stations with less than 10 years?
index_to_filter = [i for i,
                   x in enumerate(num_years < 10) if x]
index_to_filter
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_query_1.jpg)

Next, let's find **the names of the stations** that have less than 10 years of recording.

```python
#Creates a list of stations with less then 10 years of record
station_name_filtered = []

for i in range(len(index_to_filter)):
    station_name_filtered.append(
        df_db["NAME"].unique()[index_to_filter[i]])
station_name_filtered
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_query_2.jpg)

Finally, let's filter the stations that have less than 10 years of recording.

```python
for i in range(len(index_to_filter)):
    df_db = df_db[df_db.NAME != station_name_filtered[i]]
    
    
df_db
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_query_3.jpg)
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_query_4.jpg)


Note that we have **3106** rows now. Compared to the original number of **3152** rows, we have filtered *46* stations!

The whole process is very strong, but takes a lot of steps. Let's use a function to do the job!

```python
import numpy as np
def filter_df_min_obs(df,min_obs):
    """
    filter rows that have less than 
    minimum required years of record.
    
    @param df(DataFrame): the original dataframe.
    @param min_obs(int): the miminum required years of
        record in each station.
    
    @return (DataFrame): the filtered dataframe.
    """
    #take the number of years in each station
    num_years = []
    for i in range(len(df["NAME"].unique())):
        num_years.append(
            len(df[df["NAME"] == df["NAME"].unique()[i]]
                ["Year"].unique()))
    
    num_years = np.asarray(num_years)
    
    #a list of the indices of stations 
    #with less than min_obs years?
    index_to_filter = [i for i,
                       x in enumerate(
                           num_years < min_obs) if x]
    
    #Creates a list of stations with
    # less then min_obs years of record
    station_name_filtered = []
    for i in range(len(index_to_filter)):
        station_name_filtered.append(
            df["NAME"].unique()[index_to_filter[i]])
        
    #filter out the stations
    for i in range(len(index_to_filter)):
        df = df[df.NAME != station_name_filtered[i]]
    
    return(df)
```

Next step is to calculate **coefficient** of linear regression of `temp` on `year`. This is a simple step, so I create a function for this.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def coef(df):
    """
    Calculates coefficient of temp vs year linear regression.
    
    @param df(DataFrame): dataframe
        whose columns are taken for x and y.
    @return: coefficient, increase in y 
        as x increases by 1.
    """
    x = df[["Year"]]
    y = df["Temp"]
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x,y)
    return LR.coef_[0]
```

Now, the next step is to create a new dataframe that has the **coefficient, name of the stations, Latitude and Longitude of the stations**.

Let's create a dataframe that has the name and coefficient first.

```python
coefs = df_db.groupby(["NAME"]).apply(coef)
coefs = coefs.reset_index()
coefs
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_query_5.jpg)

Now, we are going to `merge` the `stations` dataframe into `coefs` dataframe, and call it `coefs_df`.

```python
coefs_df = pd.merge(coefs,stations, on = ["NAME"])

coefs_df.rename(columns = {0:'coef'}, inplace=True)

coefs_df
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_query_6.jpg)

Great! Let's transform the steps into a function.

```python
def create_coef_df(df):
    """
    Creates a dataframe of stations with average 
        yearly change in temperature.
    
    @param df(DataFrame): the dataframe to create 
        a coefficient dataframe.
    
    @return (DataFrame): a dataframe of stations 
        with coefficient.
    """
    #dataframe of coefficients only.
    coefs = df.groupby(["NAME"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    
    #merge the dataframe with stations!
    coefs_df = pd.merge(coefs,stations, on = ["NAME"])
    coefs_df.rename(columns = {0:'coef'}, inplace=True)
    coefs_df['coef'] = round(coefs_df['coef'],4)
    
    return(coefs_df)
```

Here, I added a line 
`coefs_df['coef'] = round(coefs_df['coef'],4)` to round the coef values with 4 decimal places.

Last step! Let's finally create a function `temperature_coefficient_plot()`.

```python

def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin,
                        year_end, month, min_obs,**kwargs):
    """
    Plot a map of stations for the average yearly change
        in temperature in a given country.
    
    @param country(str): the name of country to plot.
    @param year_begin(int): the beginning year to plot.
    @param year_end(int) : the end year to plot.
    @param month(int) : the month in each year to plot.
    @min_obs(int) : the minimum required years of record 
        in each station to plot.
    
    @return fig: ready to be plotted.
    """
    
    #get the dataframe from the database.
    df_db = query_climate_database(
        country,year_begin,year_end,month)
    
    #filter tha dataframe with min_obs, and
    #create the coefficient dataframe.
    df_to_plot = create_coef_df(
        filter_df_min_obs(df_db,10))
    
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df_to_plot,
                        #latitude of the station 
                        lat="LATITUDE",
                        #longitude of the station
                        lon="LONGITUDE", 
                        #when hovered, show the name
                        hover_name = "NAME",
                        #color differs by coef
                        color = "coef",
                        #default zoom size.
                        zoom=kwargs["zoom"],
                        #style of the plot.
                        mapbox_style = kwargs["mapbox_style"],
                        #scale of the colorbar, 
                        #red to gray countinuous.
                        color_continuous_scale=kwargs[
                            "color_continuous_scale"],
                        #midpoint of the color bar
                        color_continuous_midpoint = 0,
                         #range of the color bar
                        range_color = (-0.1,0.1),
                        #size of plot, width and height.
                        width = 600,
                        height = 300,
                    )
    
    months = ["Unknown","January","Febuary",
          "March","April","May","June","July",
          "August","September","October","November",
          "December"]
    
    fig.update_layout(
    margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0}, #margin of the plot.
    title_text = 
        f"""Estimates of yearly increase in 
        temperature in {months[month]} for

    title_xanchor = "center",
    title_yanchor = "top",

    title_y = 0.95,

        title="""Estimated Yearly

    )
    
    return fig
```

Now let's create the visualization!
```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

# 4. Two more interesting figures

Here, I want to see a relationship among **temperature, latitude, and longitude.** 

Let's recall the `scatter_mapbox()` function in `Plotly` package. For now, I want to see a map of **Korea**, where I am from, for years **between 1980 and 2020** on **August**, which is the hottest month of the year.

```python
#Query a new subset of the data

S_Korea_summer_df = query_climate_database(country = "Korea, South",
                      year_begin = 1980,
                      year_end = 2020,
                      month = 8)

S_Korea_summer_df
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_query_8.jpg)

I need to create a function to show a map of scatter points

```python
def visualize_scatter_mapbox(
    df,lat,long,hover,color,middle_val,min_val,max_val,**kwargs):
    """

        """,
        title_x = 0.5,
        title_y = 0.98,
        font_color = "purple"
    )
    
    return fig
```

Let's call this function to see where is the hottest in Korea in August!

```python
visualize_scatter_mapbox(S_Korea_summer_df,"LATITUDE",
                        "LONGITUDE","NAME","Temp",27,24,30,
                        zoom = 4,
                        mapbox_style = "carto-positron")
```

{% include korea.html %}

We are not done yet. Let's recall the question again:

## What is the effect of latitude and longitude on temperature? ##

To visualize a solution to this, I want to use **Russia** for example.

Here, I take data on years **between 1980 and 2020** on month **January**, which is the coldest month of Russia.

```python
Russia_df =  query_climate_database(country = "Russia",
                      year_begin = 1980,
                      year_end = 2020,
                      month = 1)
Russia_df
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_more_0.jpg)

Let's use the function `visualize_scatter_mapbox()` again for Russia!

```python
visualize_scatter_mapbox(Russia_df,"LATITUDE",
                        "LONGITUDE","NAME","Temp",-20,-50,10,
                        zoom = 0.5,
                        mapbox_style = "carto-positron")

```
{% include russia.html %}

Now, we are going to use **3d scatter plot** to see the effect of **latitude** and **longitude** on **temperature**.

Let's create a function for this.

```python
def visualize_scatter_3d(df,x,y,z):
    """

Let's see how **temperature** is changing with respect to **latitude** and **longitude** in **Russia**!

```python
visualize_scatter_3d(Russia_df,"LONGITUDE","LATITUDE","Temp")
```
{% include russia_3d.html %}

It is quite complicated to see, but it is clear that:

- As **longitude** increases, we have more **varying temperatures**, meaning there are both **cold and warm** areas. However, in areas with **low longitude** they tend to have similar temperatures.

- As with **latitude**, we have **lower temperatures** as **latitude increases**. That means, as we approach **the north pole**, we have colder areas.

## My next question is :

## How does change in latitude and longitude in East, West, North, and South states in the United States?

First, we need to take data for USA.

```python
USA_df =  query_climate_database(country = "United States",
                      year_begin = 2020,
                      year_end = 2020,
                      month = 1)
USA_df
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog_1_usa_0.jpg)

Note that I am using **January** data for year **2020**.

Let's see the temperatures in the U.S!

```python
visualize_scatter_mapbox(USA_df,"LATITUDE",
                        "LONGITUDE","NAME","Temp",0,-30,30,
                        zoom = 0.5,
                        mapbox_style = "carto-positron")
```
{% include usa_all.html %}

Let's divide the stations into **East or West**. To do this, we need to create a column and specify `East` or `West`.

Then, we assign `West` for stations **less than -98 longitude line** and `East` on others.
```python
#create a new column
USA_df["East_or_West"] = "NA"
USA_df["East_or_West"] = np.where(
    USA_df.LONGITUDE < -98,"West","East")
```

Let's visualize this on the map!

```python
visualize_scatter_mapbox(USA_df,"LATITUDE",
                        "LONGITUDE","NAME","East_or_West",0,-30,30,
                        zoom = 1,
                        mapbox_style = "carto-positron")

```
{% include usa_east_west.html %}

Do the same for **North or South**:
```python
USA_df["North_or_South"] = "NA"
USA_df["North_or_South"] = np.where(
    USA_df.LATITUDE >37 ,"North","South")

visualize_scatter_mapbox(USA_df,"LATITUDE",
                        "LONGITUDE","NAME",
                        "North_or_South",0,-30,30,
                        zoom = 1,
                        mapbox_style = "carto-positron")

```
{% include usa_north_south.html %}

Now, we are going to plot stations on each **East and West** and **North and South**.

Let's create a function for this:

```python
def visualize_facet(
    df,x,y,color,col,row, **kwargs):
    """
    Create a facet scatter plot
    
    @param df(DataFrame): Dataframe to plot
    x(str): the name of column for x
    y(str): the name of column for y
    color(str): the name to divide the colors for each point.
    col(str): the name of column to divide the data horizontally.
    row(str): the name of column to divide the data vertically
    """
    
    fig = px.scatter(df,
                    x=x,
                    y=y,
                    color = color,
                    width = 600,
                    height=300,
                    opacity = 0.5,
                    facet_col = col,
                    facet_row = row,
                    color_continuous_scale="RdYlBu_r",
                    color_continuous_midpoint = 0,
                    range_color = (-30,30),
                    )

    # reduce whitespace
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    return fig
```

So, this is **how longitude affects temperature on each station.**
```python
    visualize_facet(USA_df,
               "LONGITUDE",
               "Temp",
               "Temp",
               "East_or_West",
               "North_or_South")
```
{% include usa_longitude.html %}

Now, let's see **how latitude affects temperature on each station.**
```python
    visualize_facet(USA_df,
               "LATITUDE",
               "Temp",
               "Temp",
               "East_or_West",
               "North_or_South")
```
{% include usa_latitude.html %}

## What can we conclude from the two plots?

We have a cluster in each sup-plot, and we can see that **both latitude and longitude** affect temperature **the same way regardless of being west, east, north, or south**.
